# VERSIONING HELPER FOR MY PROJECTS

The goal of this class is to provide an easy way to implement version changes when building a newer version of an application.
Mainly for Cx_Freeze and Inno Setup use.
It would be nice to be able to store latest version and have an increment system in place but initially all I want to do is to read VERSION.txt file with a version number, ask user if this is the number they want to use for the newest build and go from there further.
